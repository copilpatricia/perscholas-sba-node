# RESTful API

## Description

I created a RESTul API using Express and Node, the guiding principles of REST, reasonable data structuring practices, and code organization practices.

I used three data categories (users, products, and reviews), and utilized route parameters & query parameters for data filtering.

I used two custom middlewares that display the date & time of the request and one error-handling middleware.

For every data category, I created GET/POST/PATCH or DELETE routes allowing client manipulation.

I rendered a view template using EJS and included a form that displays a message when the user press the "Sign in" button. To style the form I used a simple CSS to style the rendered view of the form.
